# Getting Started with Next.js and Static Site Generation

Static Site Generation (SSG) has become increasingly popular for building fast, SEO-friendly websites. Next.js makes SSG incredibly easy with built-in support and powerful features that help you create performant web applications.

## What is Static Site Generation?

Static Site Generation is a method of building websites where pages are pre-rendered at build time, rather than on each request. This results in:

- **Faster loading times** - No server processing required
- **Better SEO** - Search engines can easily crawl pre-rendered HTML
- **Improved security** - No server-side vulnerabilities
- **Better caching** - Static files can be cached globally

## Setting Up SSG with Next.js

Next.js provides two main functions for static generation:

### getStaticProps

Use `getStaticProps` to fetch data at build time:

```javascript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const data = await fetchData();

  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
  };
}
```

### getStaticPaths

For dynamic routes, use `getStaticPaths` to specify which paths to pre-render:

```javascript
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const paths = await getAllPostSlugs();

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  };
}
```

## Benefits for Blog Sites

For content-heavy sites like blogs, SSG offers several advantages:

1. **Performance**: Pages load instantly since they're pre-built
2. **SEO**: Perfect for content that needs to be indexed
3. **Deployment**: Easy to deploy to CDNs and static hosts
4. **Cost**: Often cheaper than dynamic hosting solutions

## Conclusion

Next.js static site generation is perfect for blogs, portfolios, and documentation sites. It combines the developer experience of React with the performance benefits of static sites.
