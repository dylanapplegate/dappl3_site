## 📝 Updated Documentation

### Enhanced `copilot-instructions.md`

Added comprehensive **Dark Mode Guidelines** section:

````markdown
## Dark Mode Guidelines

- All UI components must include Tailwind's `dark:` variant styles for backgrounds, text, borders, and interactive states.
- Components should be tested in both light and dark themes before PR approval.
- Any new component or layout must default to theme-aware color tokens and utility classes.
- Interactive states (hover, focus, active) must be styled for both light and dark modes.
- Do not use custom CSS unless absolutely necessary; prefer Tailwind utilities.
- Do not remove existing light mode styles when adding dark mode support.
- Avoid adding Tailwind classes without considering theme parity and accessibility.
- Do not break responsiveness while applying theme updates.

**Example pattern for new components:**

```jsx
// Before (light only)
<div className="bg-white text-gray-900 shadow-md">
  <button className="bg-gray-100 hover:bg-gray-200">Click me</button>
</div>

// After (dark mode added)
<div className="bg-white text-gray-900 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-gray-100 shadow-md">
  <button className="bg-gray-100 hover:bg-gray-200 dark:bg-gray-700 dark:hover:bg-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
    Click me
  </button>
</div>
```
````

```

4. Follow the example patterns in the guidelines

### For Maintenance
1. Run dark mode tests before releases
2. Verify theme persistence across all pages
3. Check contrast ratios for accessibility
4. Update visual regression screenshots when UI changes

### For Extensions
- Consider adding theme preference persistence
- Implement system theme detection
- Add theme-aware animations/transitions
- Extend color palette for more brand variants

## ✨ Key Achievements

1. **Complete Theme Coverage**: Every UI component supports both light and dark modes
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated visual regression testing across browsers
3. **Developer Guidelines**: Clear documentation for future development
4. **Production Ready**: Build verified, performance optimized
